<!-- Simple interest, as the name suggests, is the most straightforward to calculate. The information from the bank that you will need is just the rate known as the APY (annual percentage yield), which is then multiplied by the amount deposited (known as the principal) and the number of years that the deposit is held in the savings account. So for example, if you deposit $5,000 in a savings account with an APY of 1%, in one year you will earn $50 interest ($5,000 x 0.01 x 1). If you leave the deposit for another year, another $50 interest will be earned so that over the 2 years, total interest earned will be $100 ($5,000 x 0.01 x 2). For 3 years, total interest is $150, 4 is $200 and so on. The main point to remember is that no matter how much you have in your savings account, interest will only be earned on your initial deposit. -->

<!-- the form below requests the Amount (Principal (variable name), variable name getPrincipalValue), uses an input requester and using Css, tags to check the user hasn't entered a number below "1", prevented by using value of Min=1 and Placeholder tag "1", within input element. It displays some little bubbles under the input box, requesting the user doesn't enter this type of data. Unsure how the attributes within the span tags produce the results they do without being coded. I am assuming they have default values built into myForm.user.$error.min attribute. The form element is used to let the browser know input is to be processed and either submitted or output to the screen. And is a container for these input elements.-->

<!-- An input using the new HTML5 feature of "Sliders", for inputting value. Previously had to be hand coded in another language. Once again have used Min and Max values to specify range. This time the Step attribute has been used as well to alter the value of the slider by .5 increments. This is the interest rate (Interest (Variable name, variable, getInterestRate). The oninput command is used to sense as soon as the slider is used and assign the a label to the value. By doing this I can output the value to the right of the slider as it is altered, plus I was able to fit a % sign afterwards. Not sure what the code in the original file provided was meant to do.

<!-- Alright time to create a script that on clicking the button (input type="button") and using the onclick command to call a javascript to multiply the values after assigning them new variable names and output them to the Javascript output command document.getElementById("outputPrincipal").innerHTML. You can mix some text and values here. However due to the way Javascript determines whether it the output value is a string on Integer (Number), dependant on where the brackets and plus sign are I have been unable to add the Principal and final result together for output at the line of code that reads document.getElementById("compounded").innerHTML = "You will receive $ " + resultInterest. The var commands assign the output of the values created by the form input above to a new variable resultInterest to be used by the above line of code. Also the ouput is displayed by the block of <p id=outputPrincipal", etc elements inside a new div tag. Having used the class-simple-highlight from the Css file, I am able to color the output from the button click-->
